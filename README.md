# gene-entropy

We seek to quantify the complexity of a sequence of DNA or RNA. To do this we use two aproaches, we can first calculate the entropy of a gene or we can try to calculate it's [assembly index](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23258-x). 


Shannon entropy $H(x)$ is given by: 

$n$\
$-\sum_{k=1}^n P(x_i) log P(x_i) = H(x)$  \
&ensp;$i=1$




Additionally we have the "The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality" which we use as an example:

$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$
