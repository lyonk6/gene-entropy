AB  - In prebiotic evolution, self-replicating molecules are believed to have evolved 
      into complex living systems by expanding their information and functions 
      open-endedly. Theoretically, such evolutionary complexification could occur 
      through successive appearance of novel replicators that interact with one another 
      to form replication networks. Here we perform long-term evolution experiments of 
      RNA that replicates using a self-encoded RNA replicase. The RNA diversifies into 
      multiple coexisting host and parasite lineages, whose frequencies in the 
      population initially fluctuate and gradually stabilize. The final population, 
      comprising five RNA lineages, forms a replicator network with diverse 
      interactions, including cooperation to help the replication of all other members. 
      These results support the capability of molecular replicators to spontaneously 
      develop complexity through Darwinian evolution, a critical step for the emergence 
      of life.
